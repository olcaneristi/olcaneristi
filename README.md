#### Hey! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ogulcan Eristi.

I'm a Frontend Developer with 2 years of relevant work experience, building pretty UI's for users to have great experiences, trying to improve myself on the web & mobile and enjoys it. I'm known for my calmness but I get very excited about new ideas.

I've experienced HTML, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Next.js and React Native while working as a Frontend Developer.
